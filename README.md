# MyFirstSmartContract
I am using IBM Blockchain Plateform because I found it and thought it was hella cool.

I wanted to build a simple smart contract but didn't find any ideas. I researched on the web and find a good idea : Peer to peer Betting. The users can send the amount they want and setup a clause for the bet. We both part agreed, the smart contrat is launched and the money tranfered. I don't know how to get the result of the bet yet.
